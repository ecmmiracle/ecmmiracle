# üëã Hi, I'm Enrique ‚Äî Data & ML Engineer for ADAS/AD Systems

I'm focused on the **operational analysis, validation, and improvement of ADAS/AD systems**, using data architectures, machine learning, and backend tools to extract meaningful insights from real-world data.

Currently, I work on:
- Designing **end-to-end machine learning pipelines and data flows** that support system monitoring, diagnostics, and performance analysis
- Training and deploying ML models
- Selecting and orchestrating backend components (e.g., MinIO, Quart, MongoDB...) to support scalable, maintainable systems

---

## üöó Areas of Interest

- Operational validation of autonomous systems
- Computer vision in real-world environments
- Model deployment at scale (CV and LLMs)
- Data pipeline design and system integration
- Metrics and performance analysis for ADAS behavior
