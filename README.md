# 👋 Hi, I'm Enrique — Data & ML Engineer for ADAS/AD Systems

I'm focused on the **operational analysis, validation, and improvement of ADAS/AD systems**, using data architectures, machine learning, and backend tools to extract meaningful insights from real-world data.

Currently, I work on:
- Designing data flows that support system monitoring, diagnostics, and performance tuning
- Training and deploying computer vision models for real-time perception
- Integrating LLMs for inference and operational support
- Selecting tools and designing system components (e.g., MinIO, Quart, PostgreSQL)

---

## 🚗 Areas of Interest

- Operational validation of autonomous systems
- Computer vision in real-world environments
- Model deployment at scale (CV and LLMs)
- Data pipeline design and system integration
- Metrics and performance analysis for ADAS behavior

## 🧪 Featured Projects

> I'm currently working on building public demos that reflect real-world ADAS challenges. More coming soon!

- [`adas-systems-lab`](https://github.com/tu-usuario/adas-systems-lab) – Prototypes and architectural patterns for data-driven tools in autonomous systems (WIP)
